# SOLVING-MARIO-ENV-USING-DQN

This repository contains the code implementation for solving the Mario environment using the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm. The goal of this project is to train an agent to play the classic Super Mario Bros game using reinforcement learning.

## Mario Environment

The Mario environment used in this project is a custom implementation based on the OpenAI Gym framework. It provides an interface for interacting with the Super Mario Bros game, allowing the agent to observe the game state and take actions. The environment is designed to emulate the original game mechanics and provides a reward signal based on the agent's performance.

## Deep Q-Network (DQN)

The Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm is a popular reinforcement learning technique for solving sequential decision-making problems. It combines deep neural networks with Q-learning, a value-based reinforcement learning algorithm. The DQN agent learns to estimate the optimal action-value function, which maps states to the expected cumulative rewards.
